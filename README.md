Mathematical Simulation Visualizer
====================

This is a web-based tool that visualizes a mathematical process involving a value under probabilistic growth and decay. It is a re-implementation of a specific Desmos project, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
--------

*   **Real-time Visualization**: A live graph plots the value of `a` over 100 simulation steps, with points color-coded based on their value relative to 1.
*   **Statistical Displays**: Track the mean of the current simulation run (`Mini Mean H`) and the overall mean of all completed runs (`Mean Master H`) in real-time.
*   **Interactive Controls**:
    *   **Play/Pause**: Start and stop the continuous simulation loop.
    *   **Run 1 Iteration**: Execute a single step of the simulation.
    *   **Run 100 Iterations**: Automatically complete a full run of 100 steps.
    *   **Hard Reset**: Clear all data and reset the simulation to its initial state.
*   **Data Export**: Export the raw simulation data (`h` and `hm` arrays) to a CSV file for external analysis.
*   **Fixed Viewport**: The graph's viewport is configured to match the original Desmos project for consistent visualization.
